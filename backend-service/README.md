# Backend Service: Spring Boot

The backend service is a Spring Boot application, which is a popular framework for building Java-based applications. It provides a robust platform for developing RESTful APIs and web services. Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities:

## Technology Stack:
- **Spring Boot**: The core framework for building Java applications with ease, providing out-of-the-box configurations.
- **Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: For implementing the web layer of the application, handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API)**: Simplifies data access layer by providing repositories and reducing boilerplate code for database interactions.
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization, securing the backend endpoints.
- **Embedded Tomcat Server**: Spring Boot applications are typically packaged with an embedded Tomcat server, eliminating the need for deploying a separate application server.

## Functionality:
- **RESTful API**: The backend service exposes RESTful endpoints for communication with the frontend. These endpoints handle various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations and other functionalities.
- **Database Interaction**: Utilizing Spring Data JPA, the backend interacts with a database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or H2) to perform data persistence operations.
- **Business Logic**: Contains the core logic of the application, including data validation, processing, and any custom business rules.
- **Security**: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the endpoints and data.
- **Middleware Integration**: Integrates with other services or middleware components if required, such as message brokers (like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka) or caching solutions (like Redis).

## Configuration:
- **Port 5000**: The backend service is configured to run on port 5000. This port is where the service listens for incoming HTTP requests.
- **Spring Boot Configuration**: Configuration files (application.properties or application.yml) are used to set up database connections, server port, logging, and other application-specific properties.# task-assignment-app-backend-service
